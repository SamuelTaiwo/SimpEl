**SimpEl (Simple Element)**

Simple Element is a light Android framework for developing architecturally sound applications at speed.  
The Android Framework is a relatively low level framework for most applications needs.  
While this provides a large degree of flexibility, it often leads codebases to get unnecessarily complex.
SimpEl solves this by taking a lot of architectural choices out of your hands.
Even just a small shift in how code is written can have dramatic effects on a teams productivity.
